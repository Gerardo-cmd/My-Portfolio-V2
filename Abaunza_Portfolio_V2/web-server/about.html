        <h2 style = "margin-bottom: 0.1rem;">Computer Science Background</h2>
        <p>I am a rising senior Computer Science student at George Mason University. 
            It is there that I learned Java, Python, and C as well as various other topics such as data structures and formal methods and logic. 
            Additionally, I am self taught in Javascript, HTML, CSS and Node.js. I have coded for over two years now and love the challenge. 
            I currently reside in Centreville, Virginia and am currently looking to intern remotely or anywhere in the Northern Virginia and DC Metropolitan Area as a front-end developer
            or software engineer!
        </p>
        <h2 style = "margin-bottom: 0.1rem;">General Info About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Northern Virginia and lived around the area my whole life.
            I enjoy weightlifting as a hobby and have been weightlifting for over 4 years now. I enjoy having fun with friends playing video games, watching movies, and going on walks. I currently work as a swim instructor and a supervisor at Lifetime and have worked there for over two years.
